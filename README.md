A simple clicker.

## Changelog

- 20/6/22: Game released
- 21/6/22: Added a new gimmick, the Lever; It was previously a joke upgrade that reset. Now, the resets can be done manually (albeit with a word) and you can now get 10 free clicks be tapping some of the background in the Lever's UI Segment.
